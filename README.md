# evolutionary-strategy-optimization
Implementation of an Evolutionary Strategy (ES) algorithm for solving optimization problems using adaptive step-size mutation, tournament selection, and various objective functions. This project demonstrates the ES algorithm's capability to evolve solutions over generations to find optimal solutions.
